Hi Contact (aka Linda Nancy Birnbaum) and External Relations (aka Gene
L. Dodaro); Hester and Caroline, and Janet,


If you would like to connect with me, I am available (at your convenience).


Thank you for sharing your email addresses at your website's
(https://www.gao.gov/about/contact-us),
(https://www.sec.gov/contact-information/sec-directory), and
(https://home.treasury.gov). Thank you also, for informing
me about your office's and providing the names of the responsible individual's.


I am bringing to your notice, that I am unable to get filing (tax, tax
related and other) record's, that public and private entities
(including corporation's, LLC's, LLP's and other's) are required to
file with the IRS from the IRS website (https://www.irs.gov). To my
knowledge (aka common) the IRS website lack's tool's to get the filing
record's.


I am also unable to get filing (Securities and other) record's,
that above entities such as LLP's (Ernst and Young - US) are required to
file with the SEC from the SEC website (https://www.sec.gov). To my
knowledge (aka common) the SEC website may lack the filing record's.


In addition, I am unable to get connection's (aka link's) from the IRS
website to the
SEC website and vice versa for the respective entities and the
respective record's.
I am also unable to get connection's (aka link's) to the incorporation record's
(State website's and other) from the above website's. To my knowledge
(aka common) the above website's lack tool's (providing connection's)
for the respective entities and the respective record's.


I am available, as a partner (aka militia) for government representative's
interested in both open and/or closed contact. I have a preference
for Resident representative's (aka fresh graduate's who are in
residence training) and a preference for open contact. I also have a gender
preference - female (who have identified in the past, continue to
identify in the present and have reasonable - more likely than not -
confidence on
their identity in the future). Please, feel free to share their
profile's and email addresses with me and/or connect me with them.


I use web app's for all my communication's. A few are listed below.
I am also open to using one's you are comfortable with. It would be
great if we can setup communication's.


As alway's available, at your convenience.


Thank you,
Rakesh.

Professional).
